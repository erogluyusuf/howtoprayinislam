##  Project Mission
The primary goal of this project is to **simplify** the process of tracking prayer times and learning the prayer (Salah). It is specifically designed for:
* **Reverts:** Those who have recently embraced Islam and need a clear, non-intimidating start.
* **Refresher Learners:** People who want to remember the steps and timings of Salah in a modern way.
* **Minimalist Users:** Anyone who prefers a clean, ad-free, and straightforward interface over complex apps.

##  Key Features

* ** Simplified Timings:** Accurate prayer times for Darıca, Kocaeli (40.77, 29.35) presented in a clean, distraction-free timeline.
* ** Interactive Step-by-Step Guides:** Each prayer (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) has its own dedicated guide focusing on the essential movements and recitations.
* ** 30-Day View:** Easily scroll through 15 days of history and 15 days of future timings to plan your worship.
* ** Smart Translation:** Automatically detects your system language (EN, TR, AR priority) and uses Google Translate to ensure accessibility for every nation.
* ** Mobile-First Design:** A fully responsive web app that feels like a native application on your phone.
